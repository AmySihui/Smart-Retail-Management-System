# Smart-Retail-Management-System
# Summary
The Smart Retail Management System aims to build an automated system to help retailers manage their inventory, track sales data, and handle orders efficiently. The system follows a microservice architecture and utilizes gRPC for efficient data exchange. It also provides a GUI, allowing retailers to monitor inventory, sales data, and orders in real time.
# Function
The project contains three core microservices:
Inventory Service: Handles inventory selection, inventory change notifications, and returns-based inventory recovery.
Sales Service: Synchronizes sales data with inventory.
Order Service: Allows retrieving order history and processing product returns.
